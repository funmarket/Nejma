# **App Name**: Firebase NEJMA

## Core Features:

- Firebase Authentication: Integrate Firebase Authentication for user sign-in and sign-out using Google accounts, replacing the existing dev.fun authentication.
- Firestore Integration: Replace dev.fun's data storage with Firestore to store user profiles, videos, marketplace products, and other data.
- Video Feed: Display a feed of videos with categories, sorting, and filtering.
- User Profiles: Allow users to create and manage their profiles, including uploading profile and banner photos, adding social links, and a bio.
- Marketplace: Enable users to list and sell products and rentals, with categories, subcategories, and filtering options.
- Gossip Feed: Enable users to engage with the gossip feed which they can filter according to which creators they follow.
- YouTube Video Summarization: Provide short summaries for the linked youtube videos with the help of an AI tool to reduce video length before playing the video. The app presents a short recap in either paragraph form or via short bullet points of a specified length.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#6C47FF) to maintain the app's distinctive and energetic brand identity, suggesting royalty and artistry, reflecting NEJMA's commitment to discovering rising stars in the arts. 
- Background color: Very dark gray (#0A0A0A), nearly black, as is presently used, providing high contrast to call attention to the action and support an immersive experience
- Accent color: Bright green (#14F195) to signal activity, used in buttons and accents; draws users into NEJMA's interactive ecosystem of creative talent
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for its neutral, objective, machined appearance and contemporary, techy vibe. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use Lucide React icons, consistent with the existing NEJMA design
- Maintain a consistent layout with clear sections for video feeds, user profiles, and marketplace listings
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance user engagement and provide feedback on interactions
